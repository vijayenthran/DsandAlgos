There are two types of scalability.

Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling.

Vertical Scaling:
- In this analogy we increase the computers computation
power. But we have one large physical unit.
- We dont need load balancer.
- This uses inter process communication.
- Here since we have only one machine data is consistent.
- Hardware limit.

Horizontal Scaling:
- In this analogy we have several small units.
The requests will scale across the machines that
are provided.
- We need load balancer.
- To talk between the units they use remote procedure call.
- Data inconsistency. because During transactions if wee
need to rollback. We have to know the systems in which the
process has taken place and we need to redo that.
- Scales Well as user increases.
